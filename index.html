<h1>Diego Ortega</h1>

<p>My work as a videographer is rooted in storytelling. I go by the name shotbydaero, and my goal is to make sure the voices of the people I work with come through clearly. I learned early on that the best edits are not the ones that draw attention to themselves, but the ones that highlight the person in front of the camera. When I work with artists like poets, I focus on capturing their presence first before adding visuals or transitions. I see my role as building a stage for them to stand on, rather than distracting from what they are saying. My inspiration comes from my own background and the community around me. Growing up Dominican in New York, I always saw how small stories often carried the most weight. I try to bring that same energy to every project. A simple clip can have more impact than a flashy one if the emotion is real. That is what guides me every time I edit. Right now, I am focused on growing my craft by paying close attention to detail, consistency, and the discipline it takes to balance my creative work with school. Long term, I want to use videography as a bridge between artists and audiences. For me, editing is not just about polishing a video but about making sure the story feels alive and honest..</p>
