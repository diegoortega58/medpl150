  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For this project, I created my own geometric shapes in Illustrator and brought them into Photoshop to build a repeating pattern for my photomontage. Using Illustrator helped me design clean, sharp shapes, and repeating them in Photoshop added rhythm and structure to the final piece. I focused on keeping the shapes consistent so they would guide the viewer’s eye across the composition. Working between both programs taught me how Illustrator and Photoshop can complement each other and made the whole montage feel more intentional and unified.</p>
