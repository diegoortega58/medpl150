For this project, I worked in a pair and learned how to use the Canon camera for the first time. At first, I thought it was going to feel complicated, but once I got comfortable with the buttons and settings, it became easier and even fun. Learning how to adjust focus and aperture gave me a whole new appreciation for what goes into a photo. It’s not just pointing the camera and clicking. It’s about deciding what to highlight and how to use light, depth, and perspective to tell a story.
We picked the 3rd floor bridge area at Hunter College as our location. That space stood out because it connects two parts of the building, but also because of the way light comes through the windows. We took photos of the bridge itself from the inside, as well as the long hallways, lockers, and exit signs. Looking out the windows, we also caught pigeons flying by and views of surrounding buildings. These small details felt like they captured everyday life on campus. It showed me how photography can take ordinary things we pass by all the time and turn them into something worth paying attention to.
Playing with the camera settings made me think about how photography can represent the world right now. Focus and aperture gave me control over what to show clearly and what to blur out. That feels like a metaphor for how we all experience the world today. There’s so much happening at once—news, social media, personal struggles, and changes in the environment—but we choose what to focus on and what to tune out. In a picture, one detail might stand out while the background fades, just like how in life, some moments or issues take center stage while others get pushed aside.
I also realized how photography can be used to represent ideas beyond just documenting spaces. For example, an exit sign might look simple, but in a photo it can also speak to themes of leaving, escaping, or moving toward something new. A hallway can show transition or uncertainty, and pigeons flying by can suggest freedom or routine. Combining these images with text could push these ideas further. A single phrase next to a photo can shift how someone interprets the meaning. In that way, photography and text together can create a stronger message about our world right now whether it’s about change, struggle, or connection.
This assignment showed me that image-making isn’t just about technical skill, but also about perspective and intention. By choosing what to capture and how to frame it, I was representing my environment in my own way. At this moment in time, when the world feels busy and uncertain, photography gives us a chance to pause and notice details that might otherwise get ignored. It can also help us question what we see and reflect on what’s important. I left this experience feeling more confident in my ability to use photography as not just a tool, but a way to express how I view the world.
