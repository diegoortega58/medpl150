  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>For this project, I worked in a pair and learned how to use the Canon camera for the first time. At first, I thought it was going to feel complicated, but once I got comfortable with the buttons and settings, it became easier and even fun. Learning how to adjust focus and aperture gave me a whole new appreciation for what goes into a photo. It’s not just pointing the camera and clicking. It’s about deciding what to highlight and how to use light, depth, and perspective to tell a story.
We picked the 3rd floor bridge area at Hunter College as our location. That space stood out because it connects two parts of the building, but also because of the way light comes through the windows. We took photos of the bridge itself from the inside, as well as the long hallways, lockers, and exit signs. Looking out the windows, we also caught pigeons flying by and views of surrounding buildings. These small details felt like they captured everyday life on campus. It showed me how photography can take ordinary things we pass by all the time and turn them into something worth paying attention to.
Playing with the camera settings made me think about how photography can represent the world right now. Focus and aperture gave me control over what to show clearly and what to blur out. That feels like a metaphor for how we all experience the world today. There’s so much happening at once—news, social media, personal struggles, and changes in the environment—but we choose what to focus on and what to tune out. In a picture, one detail might stand out while the background fades, just like how in life, some moments or issues take center stage while others get pushed aside.
I also realized how photography can be used to represent ideas beyond just documenting spaces. For example, an exit sign might look simple, but in a photo it can also speak to themes of leaving, escaping, or moving toward something new. A hallway can show transition or uncertainty, and pigeons flying by can suggest freedom or routine. Combining these images with text could push these ideas further. A single phrase next to a photo can shift how someone interprets the meaning. In that way, photography and text together can create a stronger message about our world right now whether it’s about change, struggle, or connection.
This assignment showed me that image-making isn’t just about technical skill, but also about perspective and intention. By choosing what to capture and how to frame it, I was representing my environment in my own way. At this moment in time, when the world feels busy and uncertain, photography gives us a chance to pause and notice details that might otherwise get ignored. It can also help us question what we see and reflect on what’s important. I left this experience feeling more confident in my ability to use photography as not just a tool, but a way to express how I view the world.

   <h2> With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik</h2>
  <p>Reading Nesrine Malik’s article about AI slop really opened my eyes. She breaks down how the internet is filling up with cheap AI content that looks real enough to fool people, but it has no soul and no truth behind it. It is basically digital junk. And the scary part is that many people cannot tell the difference anymore. We scroll so fast that anything can pass as real if it hits us at the right moment.
What hit me most is how she explains that AI generated images and videos are not just harmless art. They are often built on biased data and the same old ideas that keep certain groups on top and everyone else in the shadows. She talks about how these systems repeat old school conservative fantasies without even trying. You get endless pictures of perfect families, women stuck in outdated roles, and a world that looks very clean and very safe but never real. It is like the internet is being dressed up in a fake memory of the past.
She also points out how this fake content pushes out real news and real struggle. When you see war or suffering turned into cute artwork, it hits you in a strange way. It feels emotional, but not in a way that makes you take action. It just becomes content. She described an AI image of a Dominican woman crying under immigration control, done in the style of a famous animation studio. Something that painful should not be turned into a cartoon for likes and shares. It flattens the real experience and makes it easy to look at instead of hard to face.
It gets even more serious when she talks about private group chats like WhatsApp. People trust the stuff that lands in their messages because it comes from friends and family. Malik mentions an older relative who believed AI generated war images simply because they arrived through trusted contacts. That is the kind of danger we never talk about enough. It is not just the public timeline anymore. It is inside our own circles. We let our guard down and that is exactly where the slop gets us.
Another thing that stuck with me is her point about emotional numbness. When everything online is dramatic or shocking or sentimental, we start to lose our sense of what is real. We get tired. Real crisis blends in with fake crisis. Real injustice blends in with exaggerated visuals made for quick attention. And when people stop reacting, those who cause the harm get exactly what they want.
Malik makes it clear that this is not a problem in the future. The tech is already here. The damage is happening now. And the worst part is that AI does not need a human face to hide behind. It produces content with no responsibility attached.
For me, her article is a reminder to stay awake. To slow down. To question what I see. And to push back against platforms that care more about attention than truth. If we do not pay attention, the internet will shape reality for us instead of the other way around.

  <h2> Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis </h2>
  <p>Reading Motherhood in Crisis left me with a heavy feeling. The Al Jazeera piece shows the reality of pregnancy in Sierra Leone through four very different women, and the more I read, the more I realized how dangerous motherhood can be in a place where the health system barely exists. The article explains that one in ten women in Sierra Leone die during childbirth. That number does not feel real at first, but the more the stories unfold, the more you understand how it happens. There are almost no resources, long distances to hospitals, and very little support for women who need help the most.
What stood out to me is how giving birth there is not just a moment of joy or fear. It is a fight to live. Almost everything about the process is stacked against these women. Some live far away from any medical center. Some cannot afford transportation. Some depend on traditional medicine because it is the only thing available. And for many, that is the difference between life and death. There are complications that could be easily treated in richer countries, but in Sierra Leone they turn into tragedies because the system is too weak to save them.
The article gives four personal stories, and each one shows a different side of this crisis. Memunatu is the distant patient, stuck in a village where proper care is almost impossible to reach. Heela is the schoolgirl whose pregnancy pulls her away from education. Kadiatu is the grieving mother who turns to traditional remedies because there is nothing else. Tetteh is the prisoner who has to carry her pregnancy inside a system that is not designed for pregnant women at all. These stories are drawn like a graphic novel, but the reality behind them is painful and raw.
Reading them made me think about how much privilege plays a role in survival. In many other places, pregnancy means checkups, doctors, and medicine. Even if things go wrong, there is help nearby. But in Sierra Leone, getting to a hospital can take hours. And even when a woman gets there, there is no guarantee that anything is available. She might find no doctor, no blood supply, or no equipment. So her survival becomes a matter of luck, prayer, and whatever the clinic happens to have that day.
This is more than a health issue. It is a human rights issue. When women die at such high rates during something that should be safe and supported, the world has failed them. The article makes it clear that motherhood in Sierra Leone is not protected. It is neglected. And that neglect steals lives every single day.
This story also made me reflect on how we talk about motherhood in general. In some places it is celebrated and supported. In others it is treated like a burden or a danger. But in Sierra Leone, it becomes a gamble with your own life. These women deserve the same safety and dignity that any mother should have.
Motherhood in Crisis is a reminder that behind every statistic is a real woman with dreams, fears, and people who love her. These women deserve better, and their stories should push us to care, to pay attention, and to demand change.
